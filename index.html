        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is David and I am a student with a passion for Linux networking and Python backend coding. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge in these areas and am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a professional.

            My interest in Linux networking began when I first discovered the power and flexibility of the command line interface. Since then, I have been fascinated by the ability to configure and manage networks using open source tools and technologies. I have gained experience with various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and CentOS.
            
            In addition to Linux networking, I am also proficient in Python backend coding. I have experience with the Flask and Django frameworks, and have worked on several projects involving database design, RESTful APIs, and server-side scripting.
            
            My passion for Linux networking and Python backend coding drives me to constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities. I am excited to continue developing my skills in these areas and look forward to contributing to projects that can make a positive impact in the tech industry.</p>
